# Triangulation
Multiple algorithms for constructing a triangulation (i.e. chordal graph) from a given base graph.

Written in Python 3, using the package networkx 2.

## Content:
- EG.py: Create an arbitrary Triangulation with the elimination game algorithm.
- LEX_M.py: Create a minimal Triangulation with the algorithm LEX-M.
- MT.py: Create a minimum Triangulation by checking all subsets of possible chord-edges (not yet fully implemented).
